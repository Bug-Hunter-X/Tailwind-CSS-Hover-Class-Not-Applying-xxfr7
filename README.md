# Tailwind CSS Hover Class Not Applying

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS hover classes are not applied correctly, despite using what appears to be valid syntax.  The issue and its solution are detailed below.

## Bug Description
The `hover:bg-blue-700` class is not applied when hovering over the div element.  This occurs even when other Tailwind classes are functioning correctly.  Possible causes include conflicting CSS, incorrect configuration, or a misunderstanding of how Tailwind's hover functionality works.

## Solution
The solution involves carefully reviewing the CSS for any conflicting styles or overriding the Tailwind class.  It might also be necessary to verify that the Tailwind configuration is correct and all necessary files are included.
